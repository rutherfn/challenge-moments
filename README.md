# 📝 Moments — 1-Hour Challenge App

**Moments** is a minimalist Android app built with Jetpack Compose that lets you quickly log meaningful moments throughout your day. It was created as part of a 1-hour personal coding challenge.

## 📱 App Idea

The goal was to create a focused, personal space where users can:
- Write a short memory or thought
- Tag it with a category (e.g., Family, Love, Music)
- View a scrollable list of past entries, each showing the moment.

This app is a base for a reflective micro-journal — something meaningful, fast, and clean to use daily.
